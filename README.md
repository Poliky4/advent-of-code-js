# Pontus Advent of Code for JS

## Getting started
- requires node >= 18
- `npm install`
- create a `.env` file and enter your session token from cookies (optional)
- `npm start` to create the skeleton for the current day (also tries to fetch the example and input data if session token exists)
- `npm t -- -w -g "Day X"` to run the tests for a given day in watch mode

## TODO
- add input to makeDay script to set up a specific day (for now you can change the date in the script)
